# basic_hash_cracker

I used python to generate wordlists that contain every combination of lower case letters for a specific word length, i.e. len1_wordlist.txt contained the alphabet and len2_wordlist.txt contained all the 2 letter combinations (aa, ab, ac) and so on.
 these wordlists are massive and cannot be put on github, you will have to generate your own or change the script to use your wordlist :) maybe down the line i will change the script to accept command line arguments to be able to select a wordlist. 
 
 this program is extremely ineffective and super basic, this was manily for me to just learn how unix does hashing and then reversing that process.
